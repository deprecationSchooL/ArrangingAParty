###Code Abbey Question
* this will eventually be a contribution to a friend of mine  
* who turned me onto this code abbey question  
* which is cool because its been a fun problem.  
* where math intersects with fun.  
  
#ArrangingAParty:  
* Dancing Pairs:   
* Match the women with who they are interested optimizing number of matches possible.  

### 2 Rule answer ~~(My Current)~~  
* Rule(1) - Women with one choice get there decision.
* Rule(2) - No man left alone.
* rule(4) - man will have more than one woman choice. therefore. now we start a group with a multiple men game!
* Rule(4.5) sometimes a matching series presents itself ... simply 2n == 2n as worst case. sometimes w + w + w + w + 2w = 2m + 2m + 2m
* 

1.5 continued.
if ... man has two choices phenomenon
if man has three choices phenomenon
female number of choices phenomenon

implement a stack? resolve when avaliable.
if grouping completion is allowed that divides the problem into smaller groups... this is way to solution!
###Issues
* print out ArrayLists ... try catch user input 
* create UML - make variables and conditions easily visable
* 
* Once Finally built and returning a result
* I need to figure out if there needs to be more complexity
* Is there something about this equation I am missing, 
* whereby I will get the incorrect solution. (note to self) 
* No Spoilers, please!
